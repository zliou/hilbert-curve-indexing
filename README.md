# Hilbert Curve Search

This project was created as a way to explore the concept of a
[Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve).

The Python script in this repo explores how one might group/index points of
interest in a 2D space along a Hilbert curve.

To run the script:
```
python3 hilbert.py
```
